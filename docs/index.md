# AI Switch Fabric Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the AI Switch Fabric project. This project implements a parameterized, intelligent switch fabric for advanced NoC (Network-on-Chip) and AI SoC designs.

## Features
- Multi-port, parameterized switch fabric
- Dynamic, programmable routing
- QoS-aware arbitration
- Congestion detection and avoidance
- Telemetry and statistics
- Management/control interface
- Ready for both open-source (Verilator) and commercial (UVM) verification

## Quick Start
- See [RTL Guide](rtl.md) for module interface and parameters
- See [Verification](verification.md) for testbench and testplan
- See [Usage](usage.md) for simulation instructions
